##  Slycoin
   In computer science, a cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency that does not rely on any central authority to uphold or maintain it. Instead, transaction and ownership data is stored in a digital ledger using distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain. However, when a cryptocurrency is issued by a single issuer or minted or created prior to issuance, it is generally considered centralized.

In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[15][16] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[17] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party. 

#### In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first published in an MIT mailing list[18] and later in 1997 in The American Law Review.[19] 

In the 1997 book The Sovereign Individual, the authors, William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson, predict that the currency used in the information age would be using "mathematical algorithms that have no physical existence",[20] which has led some in the cryptocurrency community to call the book's claim a "prophecy".[21] 

##### In 1998, Wei Dai described "b-money", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[22] Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.[23] Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. 

###### In January 2009, Bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.[24][25] In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS. In October 2011, Litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Peercoin, created in August 2012, used a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.[26] 

On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they could play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.[27] Its final report was published in 2018,[28] and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in January 2021.[29] 

In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly had voted 62â€“22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such.[30] 

In August 2021, Cuba followed with Resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.[31] 

In September 2021, the government of China, the single largest market for cryptocurrency, declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal. This completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within China.[32]
